I am a post-doctoral research associate in evolutionary dynamics and social evolution at University of Lausanne with Laurent Lehmann and Luis Santos-Pinto. 

My research interests lie in the evolution of social behaviour (cooperation, coordination) and social organization (hierarchy, institutions). Of particular relevance to my work is the question of *how mechanisms to maintain cooperation and coordination have changed during the transition from small human groups to large societies of unrelated individuals?*

My current projects investigate (i) the evolution of economic systems and (ii) the interactions between hierarchy and institutions. 

To investigate these topics, I use models ranging from analytical models, i.e. adaptive dynamics and game theory, through to numerical simulations, i.e. individualâ€“centered models and opinion formation models.

On a broader spectrum, I am interested by a range of topics including the evolution of cancer, cultural evolution, multilevel/kin selection, social interactions between human and machines, and complex systems so feel free to contact me!

<!-- ### Academic background
I obtained my master degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Montpellier in 2016. I did a PhD at Edinburgh Napier University under the supervision of [Simon Powers](https://www.napier.ac.uk/people/simon-powers) and [Emma Hart](https://www.napier.ac.uk/people/emma-hart) from 2016 to 2019. Then, I was a post-doctoral research associate in evolutionary dynamics and social evolution at Teeside University and Exeter University. I also had the chance to participate to the Santa Fe Summer school on Complex systems in 2018.
